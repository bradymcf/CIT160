    <p>There are many things to tell about the life of Brady McFarland, but today we are going to tell a shorter version of his life. Brady was born in San Jose, Califonia in 1994 to a family of five kids. Being the youngest child, Brady had a lot to look up to in his younger years. The examples of his siblings would give him hope and dilligence to become sucessful soem day. </p>
    <p>When Brady was 22 years old he moved to Rexburg, Idaho where he would attend school for the next few years. In the first few months of him being in Rexbrug he found his future wife, and a year later they got married in Hawaii at the Laie Temple. Brady recently changed his major to CIT because of his love of computers. Intro to Programming is one of his first CIT courses ever. So far, he has enjoyed all that he has learned in this class.</p>
